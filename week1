#concatenate function
  #assigns a vector to a specific object
    #if new variable name is myvariable

myvariable <-c(72,28,-9,12,11)

#if you use myvariable with function such as sqrt() you will get nan = not a number 
  #cannot get sqrt of negative number
  

#IMPORTING A DATAFRAME 
#dataframe = matrix

#make sure excel file is saved as csv
#double check number of rows

mean(EPSA15_CSV$oil.round.)
#this will retreive the mean for the variable oil.round. in the dataset EPSA15_CSV

#frequency table/count
table(EPSA15_CSV$Low.Income)

#when indexing a dataframe remember: row first, column second
EPSA15_CSV[2,5]

#table function to get counts of a categorical variable
table(EPSA15_CSV$Low.Income)

#indexing/logical statement
EPSA15_CSV$Love,Income == '1'
  #will give out TRUE FALSA statements
  
lowincome <- EPSA15_CSV[EPSA15_CSV$Low.Income == '1',]
  #will give you the number of cases for all values classified as low income in data
  #note: lowincome is a new variable name

lowGDP<-EPSA15_CSV$GDP.Round.[EPSA15_CSV$Low.Income= '1']
  #vector. here you are looking at the GDP for the low income countries.
  #makeing a new variable lowGDP
  #there are no commas after one because you are pulling out a specific variable and indexing it
  
mean(lowGDP)
#you should get the mean if the new variable.  GDP of all countries classified as low income

#For every single case in column 5
EPSA15_CSV[,5]
